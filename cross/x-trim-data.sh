# ASCII only. Drop the runtime-dead parts of an assembled kit's data, so the
# shipped kit carries Mandarin + Cantonese + English and nothing else.

#   -n   report what would go, delete nothing
#
# This trims a COPY. The kit script copies ekho-data out of the install tree
# and espeak-ng-data out of the espeak kit before calling this, so the sources
# of truth are untouched and a rebuild always starts from the full data.
#
# Why each keep is a keep (checked in the source, not guessed):
#
#   zh.dict           loadMandarin() reads it when present (ekho_dict.cpp:215)
#   zhy.dict          setLanguage(CANTONESE) reads it (ekho_dict.cpp:273)
#   pinyin.voice      Mandarin audio, loadEkhoVoiceFile()
#   pinyin.index      its offsets; setVoice() takes the .index path when the
#                     index exists (ekho_dict.cpp:557)
#   jyutping.voice    Cantonese audio
#   jyutping.index    its offsets
#   alphabet/         26 letter wavs read by addSpecialSymbols() on EVERY
#                     setLanguage() call (ekho_dict.cpp:332)
#   jyutping/         holds only COPYING-cantonese-wong, the licence for the
#                     Cantonese voice data; it travels with the data
#
# Why each drop is a drop:
#
#   pinyin/           2060 loose single-syllable wavs. Every name has exactly
#                     one tone digit, and findMatchedPinyin() matches with
#                     count = size-1 = 0, so no name can ever match: this is
#                     makeVoiceFile() source material, read only when the
#                     .index is missing (to regenerate it). The kit ships the
#                     .index. RECORDING synthesis reads a loose file only for
#                     multi-syllable names, of which there are none.
#   *.orig            the archived GSM originals; loadEkhoVoiceFile() reads
#                     exactly path+".index"/path+".voice", never .orig
#   zh_list, zh_listx, zh_patch, zhy_list
#                     loadEspeakDict() fallbacks, taken only when the .dict
#                     is ABSENT; the kit ships both .dicts
#   bo_list, ka_list, ko_list, ngangien_list, toisanese_list,
#   hakka/, hangul/, ngangien/, toisanese/, piper/, friso-dict/
#                     languages this kit does not ship, plus friso's lexicon
#                     (its segmentation code is commented out in word.cpp and
#                     it is not in Makefile.am, so friso-dict is never opened)
#   espeak's other ~95 *_dict and mbrola_ph/
#                     English is the only language that reaches espeak; the
#                     board has no mbrola. phondata/phonindex/phontab and
#                     voices/ (+lang/) stay: they are the shared phoneme
#                     tables and the voice/variant definitions (en-us+f3).
#
# /voices shrinks to Mandarin/Cantonese/English on purpose: the server probes
# each voice with setVoice() and loadEspeakDict() fails cleanly on a missing
# file (ekho_dict.cpp:932), so the probe skips what is not shipped instead of
# pretending.
