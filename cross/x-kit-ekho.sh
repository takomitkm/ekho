# ASCII only. kit-ekho: cross-link ekho, ekho-stream and ekho-server against
# the three kits, then apply the L1 gates.
#
# The gates are the ones the wiki's container-free cross-compile page settled
# on, because they are the three questions answerable without the board:
#
#   1. is it aarch64?                       (readelf -h)
#   2. will every DT_NEEDED be there?       (readelf -d against the factory rootfs)
#   3. does it ask for a symbol version the board's libc/libstdc++ does not have?
#                                           (readelf -V against 2.31 / 3.4.28)
#
# Gate 2 is checkable because the target is not guessed at: the board's library
# inventory is a recorded fact (ref/board-libs.txt, taken from the factory
# rootfs). Nothing here runs on the board.
